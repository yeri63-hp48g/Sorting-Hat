# The-Sorting-Hat
You've just received your invitation to the most famous school for witches and wizards, but due to social distancing and a global pandemic, you stuck with remote learning! No ride on the express train through the mountains, eating to your hearts content the food in the great hall. Joining sports competitions involving flying brooms will have to wait for another year. What can you do, stuck in the world of Muggles, forbidden to practice magic? Well, at least you could use magic, cleverly concealed so that no one might notice, within an old programmable calculator, to apparate an virtual sorting hat, just long enough to sort you into your eventual house. The would at least give you time to buy the appropriate colored school clothes, to match your house mates.

Since we live in the Muggle world, the closest thing we have to magic is clever programming, so we'll need to rely on that bit of trickery to come up with a solution. The sorting hat is essentially a filter, used to place you into one of four houses, each with their own unique personallity traits. To maintain authenticity to the books and films, a visit was made to the author's website, where a list of traits by house was found.

| House | Personality Traits |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Gryffindor | courage, bravery, nerve, chivalry              |
| Hufflepuff | hard work, patience, justice, loyalty          |
| Ravenclaw  | intelligence, creativity, learning, wit        |
| Slytherin  | ambition, cunning, leadership, resourcefulness |

The sorting process begins by asking asking if you match one of these traits, picked at random. If you do, a point is added to that house to mark that as a potential solution. This continues for the first five questions, afterwhich, the house totals are checked after each question, to see which one has more points than the rest. Once that occurs, the hat will announce your chosen house, the one with the most points, magically coinciding with your personality type. 

Some modifications were then added, to make the experience more entertaining, especially if used during a party, where many are present, anxiously awaiting to determine their own house membership.

- The number of personality traits was increased from 16 to 80, ie. there are now 20 traits per house, from which to determine the house which fits you.
- Once a trait has been asked, it won't be asked again. Why should it, since of course, the hat already knows the answer?
- Comments are given after each answer, to reveal what the hat is thinking, and that some answers were quite obvious!
- If any traits are confusing, not to worry. Just answer No and wait for the next question. There are plenty of words left to use.
- Only traits which you confirmed with a Yes, are considered when determining the right house at the school of magic.
- Have fun, and don't let on about the use of magic here, used to make the virtual hat come to life. Just say it was just a clever program, nothing more.
