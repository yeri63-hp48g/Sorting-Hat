# The-Sorting-Hat
You've just received your invitation to the most famous school for witches and wizards, but due to social distancing and a global pandemic, need to do remote learning! No ride on the steam train through the mountains, and joining sports competitions is entirely out of the question. What are you to do, stuck in the world of Muggles and forbidden to practice magic? Well, at least you could use magic, cleverly concealed within an old programmable calculator, to sort you into your house, once the pandemic has receeded, and life and return to normal.

Since we live in the Muggle world, the closest thing we have to magic is clever programming, so we'll need to rely on that to come up with a solution. The sorting hat is essentially a filter used to place you into one of four houses, each with their own unique personallity traits. To maintain authenticity to the books and films, a visit was made to the author's website, where a list of traits by house were listed.

| House | Personality Traits |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Gryffindor | courage, bravery, nerve, chivalry             |
| Hufflepuff | hard work, patience, justice, loyalty         |
| Ravenclaw  | intelligence, creativity, learning, wit       |
| Slytherin  | amition, cunning, leadership, resourcefulness |

I could simply just ask you match one of these traits at random, and then check to see which house that belonged to, and add a point. After adding a few questions, check the house totals. If one house has more , and the one with the highest number of matches
